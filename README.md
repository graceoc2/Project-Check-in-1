# Project-Check-in-1
1. My idea for my final project is to make code that randomly generates different poems. These poems will be randomly generated in a specific poet's style (maybe multiple and maybe combined). Right now I am thinking of randomly generating poems in the style of poet Elizabeth Bishop. The whole idea of creating a poem based on an algorithm the probability of what the poet would do really interests me.I also like exploring the idea of the ethicality of doing this.Is it ethical to take on a poet's style and make poems from ‘them’ through code?
Functions
def format_text(): 
Each poem/set of text will have to be formatted. Spaces must be removed, same with punctuation, and the poems must be split into words before the words can be used to make the generated poems. Then the words will have to be sorted into lists based off if they are nouns, verbs, adjs, etc. This may even have to be more specific like tenses or intransitive vs transitive verbs.  

def random_word(prob):
This function will count how many times a word shows up in my code and find the probability of it being chosen.This is if I go the probability route to make my poems.  

def generate_poem() 
This function will be the function that actually generates a poem based on the style of an author. This is where everything will be put together and a poem will be printed in the end.
